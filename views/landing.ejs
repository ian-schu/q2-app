          <strong>The Problem:</strong><br>
          Professional networking is pretty bad. You get reduced down to just their jobs and job status. This makes you sad.
        </p>
        <p class="section__text">
          <strong>Solution:</strong><br>
          We give you a chance to share something more meaningful about yourself with other attendees of a networking event, before you get there. Others can do the same. "Something meaningful" could be anything from sincere questions about tech or current events, to which progressive rock bands and cat breeds you're into.
        </p>
        <div class='section__subtitle'>Making Connections</div>
        <p class="section__text">
          We've got social media "lite" here: "Ask To Connect" with someone you want to talk to or somebody you meet at an event. If they connect back with you ('blind' in the same fashion as a dating app), then we consider the connection "mutual" and you gain access to each other's contact information. The idea being, you can stay connected over the long haul.
