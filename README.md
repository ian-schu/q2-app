## Project Description

Everybody hates professional networking events and mixers, right? They're transactional, superficial, performative, and scary. Wouldn't it be easier if everybody just provided a little bit of _documentation_ for themselves (what they're interested in, what kinds of conversations they want to have) so that you'd know _who to talk to about what_? That's what ReadMe is for. It allows attendees of professional events to create a temporary profile, which is purposefully exposed to every other attendee, so that one can figure out who's out there in the crowd that's worth talking to.

## Who uses it?

Professionals looking to attend local meet ups to "network" in a different way that doesn't come off as abrasive or superficial. Users will have an idea of who's attending in order to interact with them on a less cold-introduction or superficial level.

## What outputs do they need?

Users need to be able to see who's attending a given event, and look up their ad-hoc profiles to judge whether he/she would be a good connection or not.

## What inputs are needed to generate those outputs?

Each user will:

* RSVP 'yes' to attend an event
* Fill in a short event-profile about themselves, which will be visible to all other attendees of that event. MOST of these fields will be optional -- some examples:
  * Name (first and last, or just first only)
  * I have these questions
  * Ask me these questions
  * Job status (employed, seeking, etc.)
  * Noise level (I like it quiet, I like it loud, etc.)
  * Where to find me (at the event)

## What technologies do you plan to use?

* Postgresql
* Knex
* Express
* Node.js
* EJS
* AngularJS
* JavaScript
* CSS [grid, flexbox]
* HTML
